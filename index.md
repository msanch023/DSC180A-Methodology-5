## Prompts
**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic we have covered this quarter is the Majorana experiment

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
A potential investigation that I would like to pursue for my quarter 2 project is whether the imbalance of light and dark matter has an affect on humans.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
It would be nice to meet more often as some of the topics can be a bit heavy.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
The Majorana experiment involves a lot of physics and I think it would be cool to work with some physics majors to somehow expand on our project.
